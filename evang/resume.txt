GRADUATE RESEARCH

Robust and defensible system to address the problem of spam
Today's most effective spam prevention techniques all attempt to use
heuristics and machine learning to identify incoming spam on behalf of
a user or group. Unfortunately, that inevitably leads to the property
that some percentage of legitimate messages will be incorrectly flagged
as spam, breaking the delivery guarantees that most users expect from
systems like email. It's straightforward to reduce the spam identification
problem to the halting problem, and, I suspect, possible to reduce an
approximate spam identification problem (for instance, the feasibility
of correctly identifying x% of messages without error for some positive
value x) to the halting problem (or perhaps, a similar approximation-based
version of the halting problem). However, if one enacts a set of simple
economic disincentives around the transmission of unwanted messages
(in spirit not too different from existing AS peering rules), it changes
the rules to a game we can win; it becomes possible to allow end-users,
who have the unique ability to characterize email with perfect accuracy,
to penalize in a meaningful way those who send unwanted email, while
protecting legitimate use cases (such as individual correspondence and
even mailing lists).
